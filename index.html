        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          Changzhou Kangyun Machinery Technology Co., LTD established in 2021 at the city of Changzhou by me -Glukhov Pavel, Russian citizen.</p>
          
          <p>
          Actually, first business between Chinese and Russian companies began at 2018 year.</p>
          
          <p>
          At the beginning it was just small orders for food processing equipment from friends and family, (as my sister has a company in Moscow) made through taobao app. or alibaba app. (ex. Grinders, electric sieves, oil making machines, drying chambers, vacuum machines, packing equipment). Raw materials are: fruits, vegetables, berries, nuts, seeds, mushrooms Later after “PRODEXPO Moscow 2020” business meeting we started to do business with Bakeries, Biotechenergy company, Biotika-Karellia company, Zagotprom company (<a href="http://zagotprom.com/"></a>) - the Russian enterprise specializing in harvesting, cleaning and processing of forest berries collected on the territory of the Republic of Karelia.</p>
          
          <p>
          We have good relationship with reliable cargo company since that times, that has warehouses at Beijing, Wuxi, Guangzhou (Cargo9533). Another logistics partner is Russian “ACD logistics” company.</p>
          
          <p>
          All the customers are very glad to cooperate and use that equipment, so more people started to ask me for assistance in doing business with China, language barrier is still a communication trouble for many companies.</p>

          <h3>Oilfield</h3>
          <p>
            In 2020 Russian company “Innovative Industrial Company LLC.” signed an agreement with me to find reliable supplier in China for oilfield equipment. After negotiating with more than 10 factories, we finally signed a contract with “Jiangsu Hongxunoil equipment Co. LTD” (www.hongxunoil.com). Samples of Mud Gate Valves were delivered to Russia, customer is satisfied with quality and now we already prepared 2 specifications to manufacture and ship to Russia, negotiation process continues every day about future shipments as for ready to use products, as for work pieces forging parts.
          </p>

        <div class="item">
          <h3>Electronic components</h3>
          <p>
            Another direction for business development is electronic equipment. We have an agreement with Russian company “VIP IT”, that is a multidisciplinary company that has been successfully developing on the market for more than 6 years. The company sells computer equipment, peripheral equipment, related electronics and software in various customer segments. The main supplier for this direction is Shenzhen Global Hightech Import & Export Co. Ltd. Samples of the goods were already delivered to customer, quality is good, now we hope to get more orders from customers.

          <h3>Waste recycling</h3>
          <p>
            At present time I am negotiating with my Russian partner – SVPK Co. LTD, who are interested in doing electronic waste recycling business (ex. old computers, cables, office electronics, phone stations etc.). This business requires either a cheap human resources, either a good equipment to achieve result. As I have experience in that job and know all the process, can recommend necessary machines and find manufacturer here in China (for example, this company is able to provide equipment – Wanrooe machinery (<a href="https://www.wanrooe.com/">https://www.wanrooe.com/</a>)
          </p>

        <div class="item">
          <h3>Industrial design & urban environment</h3>
          <p>
            Another company was interested in manufacturing aluminum pipes of not standard shape, e.g. cone shape to use as a support of street lights – it requires a pipe shaping machine, that is made by Suzhou SLS machinery Co. located at Jiangsu, Zhangjiagang which we provided.
